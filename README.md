# Random-Variable-Generator-Using-Poisson-Distribution
This program generates random variables using the Poisson distribution. 

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses, based on a mean frequency of occurrence, the probability that a certain number of events will occur during a certain period of time. Specifically, it specializes in the probability of occurrence of events with very small probabilities.
